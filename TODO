(FIXED) Cgroup can't limit swap (by default), but can be changed in
linux-headers-3.8.0-16/init/Kconfig, not sure how.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=918951

Kernel config should be (ignore):
CONFIG_CGROUP_MEM_RES_CTLR=y
CONFIG_CGROUP_MEM_RES_CTLR_SWAP=y

Okay it is working now had to change (for ubuntu):
1.) Not necessary /boot/config-3.8.0-16-generic --> changed
CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP_ENABLED=y
2.) Added new kernel boot parameter to grub.
In file /etc/default/grub changed this line from:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet"
to:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet swapaccount=1"
And then ran: sudo update-grub.
3.) Reboot the system.


Long term:
1.) Make container with limited disk space
2.) Create password for root
3.) [SOLVED] Create another user which is
    not root (and run processes with that user).
