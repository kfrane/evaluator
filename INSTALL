Requirements:
1.) >= Python 3.2
2.) >= lxc 0.9.0 with python bindings enabled
3.) Cgroups with memory controller enabled.
    This can be checked with lxc-checkconfig,
    the output should contain the line listed below.
    Cgroup memory controller: enabled
4.) When the memory controller is enabled, it should
    also have swap accounting enabled.
    his can be enabled by setting the swapaccount boot parameter to 1.
    Instructions for Ubuntu:
      1.) Add new kernel boot parameter to grub.
          In file /etc/default/grub changed this line from:
          GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet"
          to:
          GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet swapaccount=1"
          And then run: sudo update-grub.
      2.) Reboot the system.

Installation:
1.)
  Run ./create_sandbox.sh
  It just creates lxc container named 'sandbox' from modified busybox template
  conbtained in this folder under name sandbox_template.
2.)
  Goto folder perf/ and run make.

Now you are ready to try running something in evaluator.
Goto evaluator/ folder and run:
sudo ./evaluator -m 32000000 /bin/cat
This will copy /bin/cat file to containers rootfs/tmp and run it with 32 MB
memory limit.
